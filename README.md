# SpamFilter-NavieBayes

Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between every pair of features.
I implemented a binary or binomial classification, which classifies the elements of a given set into two groups on the basis of a classification rule. In addition, all attributes in the expected datasets are treated as categorical attributes by my algorithm. You can take a look at wikipedia for more details about the algorithm.
